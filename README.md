## üõ† Problem Statement

### **Crop Guidance and Farmer's Friend - (BioTech)**

Agriculture today faces numerous challenges that traditional methods can no longer address effectively. Farmers struggle with adapting to shifting customer demands while meeting the need for high-yield, high-quality, and efficient production. To modernize agriculture and bridge this gap, it is imperative to leverage the potential of AI to analyze historical data and provide data-driven solutions that empower farmers.

## üí° Our Solution

Baisakhi AI aims to revolutionize the agricultural landscape by providing a comprehensive AI-powered platform that assists farmers in optimizing their crop selection and improving agricultural practices. The solution is built around the following key principles:

1. **Data-Driven Decisions:** The platform leverages AI models trained on over 20 years of agricultural data to recommend the best crops for a farmer‚Äôs land.
2. **Soil Analysis:** By analyzing soil parameters such as pH, nutrient levels, and climate conditions, the platform generates tailored recommendations.
3. **Web3 Integration:** Secure blockchain-based transactions allow farmers to purchase seeds for recommended crops using Ethereum, ensuring transparency and trust.

This solution addresses the twin goals of enhancing profitability and promoting sustainability for farmers, equipping them with tools to navigate the challenges of modern agriculture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

The project was developed using the Django framework and the scikit-learn library. The implementation includes the following steps:

1. **Input Form Creation:** A user-friendly web form was developed using Django, allowing farmers to input soil parameters like pH, temperature, and nutrient levels.
2. **Model Training:** Machine learning models were trained on extensive datasets from FAO and Kaggle to predict suitable crops based on soil and climate conditions.
3. **Recommendation System:** The trained model analyzes the input data to generate a ranked list of suitable crops, providing insights into water requirements, temperature tolerance, and potential yield.
4. **Result Display:** Farmers receive a detailed report with crop recommendations, including expected yields based on their land size.
5. **Security and Authentication:** Robust security measures ensure that the platform remains secure and accessible only to authorized users.
6. **Deployment:** The platform is deployed on a reliable web server, making it easily accessible to farmers worldwide.
